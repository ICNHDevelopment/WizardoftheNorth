A New Hope

it is a period of civil war,
The Pereils, magic users,
have been forced into hiding
by the Nonpereils. However,
the Pereils have been
developing a secret weapon.

You went out for a night 
drinking with your friend, Rathgar.
After having maybe a little bit
too much, you awake to find
your drunken self wandered
into a sewer of unknown 
location...
