A New Hope

It is a period of civil war,
The Pareils, magic users, 
have been forced into hiding
by the Nonpareils. However,
the Pareils have been
developing a secret weapon.

You went out for a night 
drinking with your friend, %n2.
After having maybe a little bit
too much, you awake to find
your drunken self wandered
into a sewer of unknown 
location...
